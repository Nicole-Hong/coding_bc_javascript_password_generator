# Javascript Challenge: Password Generator

## About This Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to create the application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code written with a functional and responsive user interface that operates with the input of the specific criteria defined by the users.

The password criteria are specified and validated as follows:
* Length of the password is determined between 8 and 128 characters
* Determined if lowercase, uppercase, numbers and/or special characters will be included in the password 

The app then generates the random password that matches the criteria specified in the above process and displays it on the user interface. As a next step in the development of this app, we will further improve the quality of the user experience by upgrading the interactive code.
